# Solution

Built a Spring Boot Application to provide the features described in the Technical Challenge.  
I chose the H2 database to make it simpler, but it's ready to change to another relational, having already been tested with MySql8.  
The project was organized in packages by functional role (e.g. controllers, services..).  
The docker image is built using the OpenJDK11 with O.S. Alpine.
