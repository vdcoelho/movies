# Solution

Spring Boot Application was built to provide the features described in the Technical Challenge.  
I chose the H2 database to make it simpler, but it's ready to change to another relational database, having already been tested with MySql8.  
The project was organized in packages by functional role (e.g. controllers, services..).  
The docker image will be built using OpenJDK11 with O.S. Alpine.
