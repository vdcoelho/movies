# TO DO

There some improvements to do:
- Detach the database, just for exercise purpose I chose the H2 in memory database.
- Change the authentication method to JWT.
- Improve the tracing system using ZipKin.
- Improve the treatment and resilience mainly when calling the external API.  
- Improve the treatment of exceptions.
- Map the API to Swagger.
- Improve the log.
- Improve the monitoring to use Datadog or similar.

These improvements were missing 
The frontend was built just to demonstrate and this is not in focus in this moment.
